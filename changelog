    + Removed, merged upstream.
  * debian/patches/30_gtkdoc_fixxref_warnings.patch:
    + Drop unapplied patch that we don't need anymore.
  * debian/patches/13_thread-safe-icon-db.patch:
    + Drop unapplied patch that was fixed upstream a long time ago.
  * debian/patches/12_large-mem-page.patch:
    + Drop unapplied patch, it hasn't been applied in quite some time
      and we haven't heard of any complains. Besides, the patch no
      longer applies as the code it touched has been largely reworked
      or removed.
  * debian/patches/14_ia64-wide-ptr.patch,
    debian/patches/15_ia64-use-system-malloc.patch:
    + Dropped. The former wasn't been applied and needs rebasing if still
      needed. The second is probably useless given all the other patches
      that were needed on IA64 are gone. It may not be needed anymore as
      the code that the patch tries to workaround may be fixed now.
      If these or any other patches are needed for IA64, they should be
      sent upstream so we don't run into problems like this again.

      remaining bits.
    + Don't disable YARR, JIT and MacroAssembler here, this is a more general
      problem as explained in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113638
      and we already disable those in debian/rules.
  * debian/patches/70_Add-stubs-for-missing-symbols-in-dom-bindings.patch:

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/rules:
    + Use filter instead of findstring to match the current architecture as
      findstring also matches substrings so we accidentally used stabs debug
      symbols for i386 and amd64 and disabled jit for mips.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * debian/rules:
    + Use CPPFLAGS instead of JSC_CPPFLAGS to disable JIT and MacroAssembler

webkitgtk (2.1.4-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
  - merge build and install rules so we can install right after building
    each flavor, and save space by cleaning up the build
  - clean *.pyc files in the clean target, to allow multiple builds in the
    same source tree again
  * debian/rules:
  - disable debug symbols sparc, and use stabs for armel, like we already
    do for armhf; their buildds are too constrained in terms of hardware
    resources

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * debian/compat:
    + Go back to compat 8 for now as compressed symbol files kill .deb
      compression. Also objcopy seems to take a lot of memory to compress
      debugging symbols, killing the build in some cases.
  * debian/rules:
    + Stop building with -O1 on armhf. Hopefully the compiler error we were
      getting has been fixed.
    + Build with -gstabs on armhf and kfreebsd to try to eat less memory
      and make the build succeed. If it doesn't we may have to disable
      debugging symbols as we do in many other arches.

  [ Gustavo Noronha Silva ]
  * New upstream release
  * debian/*.symbols, debian/*.install, debian/symbols.filter,
    debian/patches/01_do-not-build-testing-tools.patch, debian/rules:
  - Avoid exposing a ton of C++ symbols by not building the testing
    tools
  - We no longer build the test browsers, as well
  * debian/rules:
  - move dh_autoreconf call to its own rule with its own custom stamp,
    so we can just call binary if the build fails and we want to try again

webkitgtk (2.0.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Team upload.

  * debian/libwebkit2gtk-3.0-25.symbols:
    + Added missing i386 symbols. Should really fix the i386 build.
      Closes: #704886.
  * debian/rules:
    + Pass -I Source/autotools to autoreconf to make sure aclocal can find
      the necessary macros, as otherwise some versions such as aclocal-1.11
      have some trouble with this.
    + Add --disable-jit back on mipsel, armel and powerpc. The change was
      probably lost with the webkit2 addition.
    + Don't pass --with-gstreamer=1.0 anymore, GStreamer support is always
      1.0 now and the configure flag has been dropped.
    + Don't pass --disable-plugin-process. The flag is gone and the plugin
      process is always built for WebKit2, which is what we were doing.
    + Don't pass --disable-jit on powerpc. Instead disable JIT, YARR and
      assembler in ia64 powerpc sparc s390 and s390x as there's no
      support for MacroAssembler for them.
  * debian/patches/changeset_145551.diff:
    + Backport from upstream, implement Double2Ints in CLoop backend for
      32 bit architectures, needed for the above architectures where we
      disable JIT, YARR and assembler.
  * debian/control:
    + Build depend on libgudev-1.0-dev on linux for gamepad support.
  * debian/patches/10_hurd_getCurrentExecutablePath.patch:
    + Readd patch from #669059 that was lost. Fixes build on hurd.

  * New upstream release.
  * changeset_150117.diff, changeset_150326.diff, changeset_150963.diff:

  * debian/patches/25_bison_2.6_ftbfs.patch:
    + Backport change from upstream, fix the build with bison >= 2.6.
  * debian/patches/30_gtkdoc_fixxref_warnings.patch:
    + New patch. Ignore warnings when generating the html documentation.
      The broken links were probably already there in previous builds
      as we don't build depend on the necessary -doc packages. We will
      upload 2.0.x to unstable soonish anyway so no point in fixing
      such minor issues here.

webkitgtk (2.0.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Team upload.

  * debian/control,
    debian/rules:
    + Build depend on gcc-4.7 and g++-4.7 and set the C compiler and C++
      compiler to this version as webkitgtk now requires GCC >= 4.7 and
      the default on many architectures is still 4.6.
  * debian/control,
    debian/compat:
    + Bump debhelper compat to 9. Among other things, this brings us
      compressed debug info files. It also brings build-id debug info
      files which greatly speed up gdb start up as gdb won't have to
      checksum the (rather big) webkit debug info files anymore.
  * debian/rules:
    + Exclude libwebkit2gtkinjectedbundle.so from dh_makeshlibs as it's a
      private library and debhelper looks at every shared lib in compat 9.
  * debian/libwebkitgtk-1.0-0.symbols,
    debian/libwebkitgtk-3.0-0.symbols:
    + Add missing symbols for 32 bit arches. Closes: #704886.
  * debian/libwebkit2gtk-3.0-25.symbols:
    + Demangle symbols.
  * debian/control:
    + Bump required build dependencies according to Versions.mk.
    + Add missing build dependency on flex. Thanks to Sjoerd Simons for
      noticing this.
    + Also add other missing build dependencies (cairo, freetype,
      fontconfig and libxml).

        is the same.
    + debian/libwebkit2gtk-3.0-25.symbols:
      - Add a symbols file for libwebkit2gtk-3.0.
  * debian/watch:

  * debian/rules:
    + Run dh_autoreconf. Makes it easier to backport upstream patches
      that modify autotools files.
  * debian/control:
    + Mention "dummy" in libwebkit-dev's long description to shut
      lintian up.
    + Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4; no changes needed.
    + Bump libharfbuzz-dev's minimum build dependency to pick up a
      dependency against the new libharfbuzz0a package.
